       <h4> Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h4>
       <centre>
       <ul>
            <li>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa </li>
            <li>1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, <br> thanks to a Depression era program known as the <br>"National Youth Administration"</li>
            <li>1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the<br> Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how<br> food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me." </li>
            <li>1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service </li>
            <li>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to<br> budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school<br> study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-<br>resistent plants. </li>
            <li>1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but<br> is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof<br> glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied<br> science. </li>
            <li>1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
            <li>1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology<br> program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different<br> strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for<br> each major climate on Earth.</li>
            <li>1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling<br> wheat yields </li>
            <li>1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-<br>yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to <br>fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat. </li>
            <li>1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the<br> Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to<br> a rapidly expanding population</li>
            <li>1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize </li>
            <li>1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their<br> maize and sorghum yields </li>
            <li>1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
            <li>2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."<br> Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can<br> meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops<br> are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically<br> modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called<br> it science, people were selecting the best breeds." </li>
            <li>2009 - dies at the age of 95.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching <br>contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and<br> progress." </p>
